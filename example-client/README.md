`A* with Avoidance` Algorithm

## Compiling

Make sure you install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
Then, from the root of the project directory, run:

```bash
npm install
```

which installs all packages into the `node_modules` folder.
Then run:

```
npm start
```

to actually run the program.

To include the JSON web token, create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following contents:

```text
JWT=<<<Put JWT Here>>>
```

Replace `<<<Put JWT Here>>>` with the actual JSON Web Token.
